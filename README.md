A simple proxy server created by [@SamJakob](https://github.com/SamJakob/) for [Hoppscotch](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/) and formerly hosted by [Apollo Software Limited](https://apollosoftware.xyz/).

## Installation üì¶
**Proxyscotch requires `zenity` on Linux. This is available in most distribution package managers.**

We're still working on automated installers. For now, copy the binary to a user-writeable location and launch the application.  
A dialog will open and explain the certificate installation process - there are more detailed instructions in our [wiki](https://github.com/hoppscotch/proxyscotch/wiki).

## Demo üöÄ

## Building üèóÔ∏è

*These are bash scripts. In order to execute them on Windows, you will need to use some form of bash shell on Windows. We recommend [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/).*

- macOS:
```bash
# To build the desktop tray application:
$ ./build.sh darwin

# To build the server application:
$ ./build.sh darwin server
```

- For Linux desktops:
```bash
# To build the desktop tray application:
$ ./build.sh linux

# To build the server application:
$ ./build.sh linux server
```

- For Windows desktops:
```bash
# To build the desktop tray application:
$ ./build.sh windows

# To build the server application:
$ ./build.sh windows server
```

> The build output is placed in the `out/` directory.



## Installers üßô
The `installers/` directory contains scripts for each platform to generate an installer application.  
Each platform's installer directory, contains the relevant information for that installer.
- [macOS](installers/darwin)
- [Windows](installers/windows)
- [Linux](installers/linux)



## Usage üë®‚Äçüíª
### Desktops üñ•Ô∏è
The proxy will add a tray icon to the native system tray for your platform, which will contain all of the options for the proxy.

### Servers üñß
To use the proxy on a server, clone the package, build the server using the instructions above, and use:
```bash
$ ./out/<platform>-server/server --host="<hostname>:<port>" --token="<token_or_blank>"

# e.g. on Linux
$ ./out/linux-server/server --host="<hostname>:<port>" --token="<token_or_blank>"

# or on Windows
$ ./out/windows-server/server.exe --host="<hostname>:<port>" --token="<token_or_blank>"
```

- The `host` and `token` parameters are optional. The defaults are as follows:
- `host`: `localhost:9159`
- `token`: blank; allowing anyone to access (see below)

**NOTE:** When the token is blank it will allow *anybody* to access your proxy server. This may be what you want, but please be sure to consider the security implications.

#### Server Command-Line Options

The server binary supports various options to customize your instance. Each of these are in the format shown in the example above, e.g., `host` would be specified as `--host="your host here"`, or banned outputs would be `--banned-outputs="banned output 1,banned output 2"`.

- `host` (default: `localhost:9159`) -- the hostname the server should listen on.
- `token` (default: `<blank>`) -- the proxy Access Token used to restrict access to the server (feature disabled if left blank).
- `allowed-origins` (default: `*`) -- a comma separated list of allowed origins (for the Access-Control-Allow-... (CORS) headers) (use * to permit any)
- `banned-outputs` (default: `<blank>`) -- a comma separated list of values to redact from responses (feature disabled if left blank).
- `banned-dests` (default: `<blank>`) -- a comma separated list of destination hosts to prevent access to (feature disabled if left blank).

Each of these may be passed as command-line parameters so to apply these or deploy changes, simply change your invocation of the Proxyscotch server to your preferred command-line options and re-run proxyscotch.
